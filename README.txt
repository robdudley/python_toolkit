Welcome to the Python Toolkit
=============================

This project is a series of snippets of Python 3 code to help you write Python
programs.

Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly.

For more info on Python see the "Resources" document in this toolkit.

How it's organised
==================

Each of the folders relate to a topic and each file within the folder relates to
a specific Python command.

Files have comments to explain how they should be used.

The folders have numbers to keep them in order and the files also have numbers
to keep them in order.

Normally you should start with lower numbers are work your way up.

How to Use
==========

You will need:

 * Python 3 installed on your computer
 * A text editor

 or

 * An account at Python Anywhere (https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) with a
   Python 3 Console

We recommend that you start your Python project by copying the contents of

  00_templates/basic.py

into your editor.

You can then start adding more Python fragments from the various folders to build
up your program.
