# We can assign data to variables using the = sign
# Variables can be reassigned or assigned to each other

# Variable names should be written as lower case words seperated by underscores

my_variable = 1 # we've stored the number 1 in this variable

my_other_variable = "Hello Python" # we've stored a string in this variable

my_last_variable = my_variable # this is assigned the value of my variable

my_last_variable = 3.14159 #and it's reassigned to Pi
